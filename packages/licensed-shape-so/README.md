# `licensed-shape-so`

You cannot legally use these. They are licensed to @bengreenier - however, since their intended use is client-side JS, I feel it's ok to check them in.

Please do not do a bad thing and use these for another project. Thanks.

## Usage

```
import shapes from '@overlayed-app/licensed-shape-so'

// shapes.* are grommet-boxed react components of shapes
```
